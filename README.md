WARNING
=======

**The scheduler is now distributed as part of [Mihini](http://www.eclipse.org/mihini/). This version isn't maintained anymore.**

About
=====

Sched is a Lua collaborative scheduler: it allows several Lua tasks to
run in parallel, and to communicate together when they need to
interact.

It offers a convinient way to write programs which address multiple
I/O driven issues simultaneously, with much less hassle than with
preemptive multithreading frameworks; it also doesn't require
developers to adopt unusual programming styles, as expected by Erlang,
map-reduce variants, or callback-driven frameworks such as node.js.
Among other appropriate usages, it allows to easily write and deploy
the applications typically powering machine-to-machine
infrastructures.

This repository is a preliminary and separate release of Lua sched,
normally part of Sierra Wireless' M2M development framework.

A developer preview of Sierra Wireless' Lua SDK is available on 
[the Lua Workshop '11 website](http://www.lua.org/wshop11.html)
[[PDF]](http://www.lua.org/wshop11/m2m-embedded-development-with-lua.pdf).

Sierra Wireless Modules
-----------------------

The following modules have been developped and are released by Sierra
Wireless. Although the current release lacks a compiled documentation,
every public API is properly documented with LuaDoc-compatible comment
headers.

- `sched`: the scheduler itself

  - `sched.lock`: mutexes and synchronization

  - `sched.pipe`: communication queues

- `checks`: a library to quickly and easily check Lua function and arguments,
   and generate proper error message when invalid arguments are detected.

- `print`: a Lua table pretty-printer, used among others by the shell

- `shell.telnet`: an interactive shell served over telnet

- `log`: a configurable applications log system, allowing fine-grained
  control over verbosity, as well as selective redirection of logs
  toward different back-ends.

- 'rpc': allows different Lua VMs to control each other, and to spawn new
  slave VMs, with or without a scheduler in them. It allows to use several
  CPUs simultaneously, and to segregate modules which don't play fair with
  the collaborative scheduler in their own process. VMs don't have to be
  on the same computer, they communicate over TCP.

Quick overview
==============

Scheduling API
--------------

New tasks are created by passing a function to `sched.run()`.
Communication and synchronization are usually best performed through
signal emission and monitoring, cf. `sched.signal`, `sched.wait`,
`sched.sigrun` etc. for detailled explanations.

For more advanced inter-task communications, check out `sched.lock`
and `sched.pipe`.

The scheduler is started by calling `sched.loop()`, which never
returns. You must have scheduled at least one task with `sched.run`
before starting the loop, otherwise your program won't do anything.

This scheduler is a collaborative scheduler: it won't preemptively
stop a task which never perform any blocking/rescheduling
operation. It is not suitable for real-time operations: these must be
performed in a separate thread on a real-time process, and then
optionally interfaced with Lua for convinience. A rogue task might
lock the whole lua_State in which it runs.


Interactive development
-----------------------

Since the loop blocks forever, it prevents interactive development
over the usual Lua shell. However, if you start a `shell.telnet` task,
you will be able to interact with a telnet client. For instance, you
can connect to a shell launched as below with "`telnet localhost
2000`":

     require 'sched'
     require 'shell.telnet'

     function main()
         shell.telnet.init{
             address     = '0.0.0.0', 
             port        = 2000,
             editmode    = "edit",
             historysize = 100 }
     end

     sched.run(main)
     sched.loop()

The shell offers history navigation, the usual edition capabilities,
and auto-completion. In addition, it supports the following features:

* an expression prefixed with "=" will print this expression's value
  on the shell, as does the usual Lua shell.

* an expression prefixed with ":" will print this expression's value
  on the shell in a detailed way: tables will be properly
  pretty-printed and indented. The system is protected against
  recursive tables.

* a statement prefixed with "&" will be launched in the background:
  the user can enter new commands in the shell before the task
  terminates.

* Ctrl-Z, pressed when a task is in the foreground and locks the
  shell, will put the task in the background and give back control
  over the shell.

* Ctrl-C, pressed when a task is in the foreground and locks the
  shell, will kill the task and give back control over the shell.

Installation
============

The external needs are:

* a Lua 5.1 VM (`sudo apt-get install lua5.1` on Ubuntu);
* the Lua 5.1 C header files, available on
  [the Lua website](http://www.lua.org/versions.html#5.1);
* GCC and Gnu Makefile.

This distribution has been successfully tested on Linux 32 and 64
bits. You need to edit the `LUA_INC` path to Lua headers in the
Makefile, then run `make`.

The LuaSocket port does NOT work under Mac OS X.

You can then either install the result (everything except the `c`
folder, the `Makefile`, `sample.lua` and the `fetch.lua` script) in a
Lua directory, or run it directly from the current directory. In the
later case, beware that by default, the `"./?/init.lua"` loader path
isn't included in the Lua path. You'll have to do a:

     export LUA_PATH="./?.lua;./?/init.lua"

You can test it with the sample provided:

     $ make
     $ export LUA_PATH="./?.lua;./?/init.lua"
     $ lua sample.lua


Important warnings
==================

This is a preliminary release, in response to interest expressed
towards Sierra Wireless' work. APIs are likely to change without
regard for backward compatibility.

The scheduler-adapted version of LuaSocket does not work under
Mac OS X, for yet uninvestigated reasons.
